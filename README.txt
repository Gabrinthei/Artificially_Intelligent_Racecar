This program was a project for my recent clase: Artificial Intelligence.
There were still a few bugs to sort out, but for the most part, the agent was able to make it to the finish line in pretty short time.
The agent is guided by a Reinforcement Algorithm called "Value Iteration" and then also by "Policy Iteration" to smooth the percent error.
